# Session 1: Introduction to Unix/Linux

## 1. What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is a software layer between user applications and computer hardware.  
It manages:
- CPU
- Memory
- Input/Output devices (printers, keyboard, screen)
- Files and storage  
- Multiple programs running at once (multitasking)

Without an OS, each program would need to control hardware directly.

---

## 2. Goals of an Operating System
- Execute user programs
- Make systems easy to use
- Manage hardware efficiently  
⚠️ Convenience and performance often conflict, so OS must balance both.

---

## 3. Examples of Operating Systems
- Android  
- macOS  
- Windows  
- Linux/GNU  

---

## 4. Advantages/Disadvantages of Operating Systems
### Advantages
- Manages internal/external devices
- Provides drivers & interfaces
- Supports multitasking
- Organizes files
- Allocates resources efficiently

### Disadvantages
- Errors can lead to data loss
- Vulnerable to viruses
- Learning new OS takes time
- Uses CPU/memory, reducing performance

## 5. History of Operating Systems (Brief Timeline)

### **1950s–1960s**
- Early computers had no OS  
- First OS: **GM-NAA I/O (1956)**  
- Batch processing systems

### **1960s**
- Multiprogramming introduced  
- Timesharing systems (CTSS 1961, Multics 1969)

### **1970s**
- **Unix created in 1971** by Ken Thompson  
- Simple, portable, multiuser  
- Home PCs begin to appear

### **1980s**
- GUI Operating Systems emerge (Mac 1984, Windows 1985)  
- TCP/IP adopted → Internet era begins

### **1990s**
- **Linux kernel released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds**  
- GUIs improve (Windows 95, KDE, GNOME)

### **2000s–Present**
- Smartphones (iOS 2007, Android 2008)  
- Cloud computing explosion  
- AI integration

---

## 6. Why UNIX Was Created
1960s OS problems:
- Expensive, complex, vendor-specific
- Not portable, incompatible

**Multics** attempted to solve these but failed due to complexity.

➡️ Ken Thompson created **Unix** to be:
- Simple  
- Portable  
- Multiuser  
- Efficient  

---

## 7. Key People in Unix History
- **Ken Thompson** → Wrote Unix  
- **Dennis Ritchie** → Created C language  
- Unix rewritten in C → *Highly portable* → Spread globally

---

## 8. Open Source Foundations

### BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
- Started in 1977  
- Improved Unix with networking tools  
- Lawsuit with AT&T → solved in 1994  
- Result: **fully open Unix-like system**

### GNU Project (1983)
- Goal: Create a fully free Unix-like OS  
- GNU provided tools → but not a kernel

---

## 9. What is Linux?

Linux is **NOT** an operating system.  
Linux is **a kernel** released in 1991.

Linux + GNU tools = GNU/Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.)

---

## 10. Linux vs UNIX (Summary)

| Feature | Linux | UNIX |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Source | Open-source | Mostly proprietary |
| Cost | Free | Paid |
| Usage | Servers, desktops, mobile | Enterprise servers |
| Customization | Very high | Limited |
| Examples | Ubuntu, Debian | AIX, HP-UX, Solaris |

---

## 11. Why Linux?

- Secure & stable  
- Free & open-source  
- Community supported  
- Dominates servers, cloud, IoT, supercomputers  
- Ideal for developers

---

## 12. Where is Linux Used?

- **Servers** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Supercomputers** (90%+ run Linux)
- **Embedded/IoT** (TVs, routers, smart devices)
- **Android OS** (built on Linux)
- **Desktop environments**

---

## 13. Linux Distributions

There are 600+ Linux distributions (300 active).  
Examples:
- Arch
- Debian
- Fedora
- openSUSE
- RedHat
- Ubuntu
- Linux Mint

Each distro has different goals: security, lightweight, enterprise, education, etc.
